                  If I’m gonna be honest there still isn’t really that much I’d like to say about myself, but I’ll try again anyway, I can just update this later anyways.

                  Hello! My name is Terence Bronaugh. I’m 22 years old and have low self-esteem.... yeah thats pretty much it, all I really do is joke about it, play video games, and rush to do assignments like this at the last second. I hope thats not too depressing to read! To be fair, there is nothing of substance to anything on this site. Stop reading it.

                    All jokes aside, there isn’t much to say about me. I simply enjoy good eats, playing video games, and making video games (or at least attempting to for now). When it comes to skills I guess it would be my self-taught knowledge in the coding language Lua, and some basic skills in Python and C#, outside of programming I don’t really have much else going for me so thats pretty much it. In my free time im either playing games, watching youtube or looking up how to make some sub-system for a game idea I have.

                    For my Attributes, I'm also mostly at a loss here cause I'm not particularly dependable or have meticulous attention to detail, I'm just fairly honest, and once I'm interested in something I'll typically work pretty hard on learning/figuring it out. I'm also pretty good at managing my emotions I guess? it wasn't hard working in customer service despite the fact that I'm an introvert and don't like social environments.

                    My Personal and Professional values are pretty simple. In my personal life, I heavily value my family, and in my work like strive for consistency. In either, I try to uphold any promises that I make.
